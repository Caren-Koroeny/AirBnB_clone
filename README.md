# 0x00. AirBnB clone - The console

## 0x00.Table of contents

### 0x01 Introduction

This is a team project to build a clone [AirBnB](https://www.airbnb.com/)

The console is a command interpreter to manage objects abstraction between objects and how they are stored.

The console will perform the following tasks:

	- create a new object

	- retrive an object from a file

	- do operations on objects

	- destroy an object

### Storage

- All the classes are handled by the `Storage engine` in the `FileStorage` Class.
- Console.

The console is a command line interpreter that permits management of the backend of HolbertonBnB. It can be used to handle and manipulate all classes utilized by the application (achieved by calls on the storage object defined above).

### Using the console.

- The AirBnB_clone console can be run both interactively and non-interactively. To run the console in non-interactive mode, pipe any command(s) into an execution of the file console.py at the command line.
